EV sales case study has the dataset where few functions are used to analyse them properly

üöóüîã Excited to share a recent project where I explored electric vehicle (EV) sales data using advanced Excel functions to draw meaningful insights! The dataset I worked with contained various fields like region, category, parameter, mode, powertrain, year, unit, and value. Here‚Äôs how I approached some of the key questions:

1Ô∏è‚É£ I began by reorganizing data horizontally using the HLOOKUP function to find specific values for Austria in the dataset, focusing on parameters 1 and 2.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Next, I used the LOOKUP function to extract the value for Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV), demonstrating how quick and efficient this function can be for fetching relevant data.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Creating Pivot Tables was the next step, which allowed me to summarize data by region and powertrain, providing a deeper understanding of the EV sales landscape. I also created pivots to display category vs. value, and mode vs. unit, showcasing the flexibility of pivot tables in presenting multidimensional data.

4Ô∏è‚É£ The FILTER function proved invaluable for narrowing down the data by region, powertrain, parameter, and unit, as well as filtering out car-specific values. This function made it easy to drill down into the most relevant data.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Lastly, I applied the SWITCH function to categorize values based on their price, allowing for a quick determination of whether a vehicle was categorized as ‚Äúexpensive,‚Äù ‚Äúmost expensive,‚Äù or ‚Äúcheap.‚Äù

üí° This project provided hands-on experience in harnessing the power of Excel‚Äôs advanced functions to simplify data analysis and drive insights from complex EV sales data. #Excel #DataAnalysis #EVSales #ElectricVehicles #PivotTables #DataInsights #ExcelforBusiness #VLOOKUP #HLOOKUP #ExcelFunctions #Sustainability
